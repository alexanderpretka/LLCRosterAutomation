# LLC Roster Automation
This VBA macro streamlines the process of generating roster files for 25 different Living Learning Communities (LLCs) by automatically creating and saving 25 separate Excel workbooks, each uniquely named and pre-filtered based on specified criteria.

Previously, this task took approximately 3 hours when done manually. With this macro, the same task now takes just 10 minutes, representing a 94.4% decrease in processing time.
