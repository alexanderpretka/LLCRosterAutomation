# LLC Roster Automation
This Microsoft Excel VBA macro streamlines the process of generating roster files for 25 different Living Learning Communities (LLCs) by automatically creating and saving 25 separate Excel workbooks, each uniquely named and pre-filtered based on specified criteria. The macro processes a master Excel file containing over 16,000 rows of student data, identifying and organizing both first-year students and upper-class students across various LLCs.

Previously, this task took approximately 3 hours when done manually. With this macro, the same task now takes just 10 minutes which has a 94.4% decrease in processing time.
