# LLC Roster Automation

For one of my projects during my Graduate Assistantship with Residence Life, I had to automate the process of updating Penn State's 25 Living Learning Communities (LLCs) student rosters. Previously, this task took approximately 3 hours when done manually due to the need to repeatedly filter the master spreadsheet by LLC, delete identifying student information, copy the relevant data into new workbooks, rename and save each file individually, and double-check for accuracy. The challenge was that the roster needed to be updated regularly with new students, changes in leadership roles, and removals, all while ensuring accuracy and consistency across multiple Residence Halls. To address this, I created a Microsoft Excel VBA macro that automated the data entry and update process. This macro processes a master CSV file that is downloaded from eLiving that contains over 16,000 rows of student data which identifies and organizes both first-year students and upper-class students across various LLCs. This macro then automatically saves the 25 separate Excel workbooks in a folder on a user's desktop.

With this macro, the same task now takes just 10 minutes which has a 94.4% decrease in processing time for Penn State Residence Life faculty members. This innovation not only saved time but also improved collaboration across faculty associates and student leaders associated with the LLCs.
